Includes program's I've built 2015-2016: robot challenge, fishtank, etc.
If you're working on any of these ENGR 120 challenges for Louisiana Tech University as I have, please do not steal my work. I have heard of people getting expelled for stealing programs off of GitHub.
I'm currently an amateur programmer looking to improve and learn more deeply how to code.
